# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to identify the key factors contributing to heart disease and develop a predictive model to classify individuals as likely to have or not have heart disease. It also includes a Tableau dashboard to visualize insights.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and prevention are key to reducing mortality rates. This project uses patient health data to explore patterns and build a predictive model for heart disease.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/` — Cleaned dataset used for analysis  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling  
- `tableau/` — Tableau packaged workbook (`.twbx`)  
- `images/` — Screenshots of the Tableau dashboard

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboard  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identification of categorical and numerical variables  
- Age-wise and gender-wise analysis of heart disease  
- Correlation study of features like cholesterol, blood pressure, thalassemia  
- Visualization using bar charts, scatterplots, and boxplots

---

## 🤖 Modeling

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Target Variable**: `Target` (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)  
- **Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy  
- **Result**: _(Update with your actual accuracy if available, e.g., 84%)_

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard has been created to highlight:

- Gender vs Heart Disease
- Age distribution among healthy and diseased individuals
- Cholesterol and Resting BP impact
- Other CVD risk factors
